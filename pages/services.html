                      <h3>Outsource Internal Audit</h3>
                      <p>The traditional model of the internal audit function was as a department internal to the host organization with a reporting line to either the CEO or the CFO and the Audit Committee. Much has changed in the discipline of internal audit over the past 10 years. The change has come about due to the increasing pressure on Audit Committees to take on expanded roles to ensure the effectiveness of governance and the work of the oversight body for financial reporting, risk management and the control framework of organizations.</p>
                      <h3>The following were cited as reasons for outsourcing:</h3>
                      <li>Provide savings in budget</li>
                      <li>Improve the internal audit product by contracting for audit skills not available on current internal audit staff</li>
                      <li>To provide operational as well as financial reviews</li>
                      <li>The accounting firms have done too good a job indicating CA can do the work better.</li>
                      
                      <h3>The Team</h3>

                        <p>More recently, governments around the World have begun to switch to financing capital investment like power, water and housing projects off balance-sheet instead of issuing government securities. An important part of this trend is PPP (Public Private Partnerships) and PFI (Private Finance Initiative), pioneered in the UK and becoming widespread around the globe. Why is project financing being increasingly relied on to fund investments What advantages does it have over traditional corporate finance? Why did some structures fail whereas others succeed? How do the governance mechanisms in such structures work? What are the valuation challenges posed by such structures? What financing innovations have they generated and how are these valued? These are the questions we will address to our clients.</p>
