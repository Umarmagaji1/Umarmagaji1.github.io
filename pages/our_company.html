              <p><h3>Overview </h3>
                  In todayâ€™s competitive environment it is important to have professional advice on cost management strategy that is properly tailored to achieve organisation goals. Traditional cost control systems tend to be based on the preservation of the status quo and the ways of performing existing activities are not reviewed. The emphasis is on cost containment rather than cost reduction. In contrast, strategic cost management focuses on cost reduction rather than cost containment.
                  
                  <h3>Our Approach</h3>
                  Our main efforts are concentrated on those actions that are taken by managers to reduce costs, some of which are prioritized on the basis of information extracted from the accounting system. Other actions however are undertaken without the use of accounting information. They involve process improvements, where an opportunity has been identified to perform process more effectively and efficiently, and which have obvious cost reduction outcomes. It is important that accountants are aware of all the approaches that can be used to reduce costs even if these methods do not rely on accounting information. You should also note that although cost management seeks to reduce costs, it should not at the expense of customer satisfaction. Ideally the aim is to take actions that will both reduce costs and enhance customer satisfaction.
                  
                  <h3>Services</h3>
                  Our services include:
                  <li>Explain the typical pattern of cost commitment and cost incurrence during the stages of operations.</li>
